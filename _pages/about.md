Hello! I am a Master's Student in Machine Learning at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu) advised by [Prof. Deepak Pathak](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dpathak). Before CMU, I completed the [_Ing√©nieur Polytechnicien_](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program) Master's degree at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu) and worked with [Prof. Maks Ovsjanikov](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~maks/) on 3D Computer Vision. 

In 2022, I interned at the [Princeton Vision and Learning Lab](https://pvl.cs.princeton.edu), and worked with [Prof. Jia Deng](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jiadeng/) on finding more efficient deep learning architectures for Computer Vision. 

I am primarily interested in topics related to perception and generalization, with a focus on 2D/3D scene understanding and vision-language models. 

<!---
My research interests lie at at the intersection of computer vision and artificial intelligence, . In particular, I am interested in 2D/3D scene understanding, self-supervised learning, multimodal machine learning in topics related to generalization and perception, with a focus on multimodal machine learning and 3D computer vision.
