Hello! I am a research intern at [Cartesia](https://cartesia.ai/) working on multimodal foundation models using state-space models. I just finished a Master's degree in Machine Learning at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu) advised by [Prof. Deepak Pathak](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dpathak) where I explored how to learn controllable representations from simulators and generative models.

I am interested in topics related to reasoning and multimodal ML, in particular I am excited about exploring deep learning architectures with better reasoning inductive biases, combining program synthesis / search / simulation with deep learning, and learning controllable and causal representations from multi-modal data.

Before CMU, I completed the [_Ing√©nieur Polytechnicien_](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program/ingenieur-polytechnicien-program) Master's degree at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu), majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. In 2022, I interned at the [Princeton Vision and Learning Lab](https://pvl.cs.princeton.edu), and worked with [Prof. Jia Deng](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~jiadeng/) on finding more efficient deep learning architectures.

I love problem solving and competitive programming: I was reserve member of the team that [ranked 4th](https://swerc.eu/2020/theme/scoreboard/index.html) in the ACM ICPC Europe Regional competition (SWERC) in 2020/2021, I am in the [top 3%](https://www.mathraining.be/users/363) of a Belgian IMO preparation website, [achieved](http://www.usaco.org/current/data/dec16_gold_results.html) USACO Platinum level, [ranked 8th](https://orac.amt.edu.au/fario/fario17results.html) at the French-Australian Regional Informatics Olympiad (FARIO) and coached for the French [Algorea](https://algorea.org) national algorithmics competition. 

<!-- 
Some papers I find exciting and would like to explore include: [DreamCoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08381), [Voyager](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291), [MuZero](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265) and [Generalist Neural Algorithmic Learner](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.11142).

I also built an electric rocket that I [presented](https://iafastro.directory/iac/paper/id/64940/summary/) to the International Astronautical Congress.

My research interests lie at at the intersection of computer vision and artificial intelligence, . In particular, I am interested in 2D/3D scene understanding, self-supervised learning, multimodal machine learning in topics related to generalization and perception, with a focus on multimodal machine learning and 3D computer vision.
