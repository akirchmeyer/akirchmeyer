Hello! I am a Master's Student in Machine Learning at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu) advised by [Prof. Deepak Pathak](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dpathak). Before CMU, I was a Master's student at [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu) and worked with [Prof. Maks Ovsjanikov](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/~maks/). 

I am primarily interested in topics related to generalization and perception, with a focus on 2D/3D scene understanding and multimodal machine learning. 

# My research interests lie at at the intersection of computer vision and artificial intelligence, . In particular, I am interested in 2D/3D scene understanding, self-supervised learning, multimodal machine learning in topics related to generalization and perception, with a focus on multimodal machine learning and 3D computer vision.
